👋 Hi, I’m Mohit Kumar

🚀 Software Engineer | Full-Stack Developer | Cloud & AI Enthusiast

I design and build scalable backend systems, modern web applications, and cloud-native solutions. My recent work focuses on **FastAPI**, **Docker**, **PostgreSQL**, **Redis**, **LLM integrations**, and **Azure AI services**, with a strong emphasis on clean architecture, observability, and developer experience.

🧠 What I’m working on lately:

- Designing **containerized microservices** using Docker & Docker Compose
- Implementing **robust backend systems** with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy & Alembic
- Exploring **MCP servers**, LLM orchestration, and AI automation workflows
- Strengthening cloud fundamentals on **Azure**

🛠 Tech Stack:
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic
- **Frontend:** Modern JavaScript, React (learning & building)
